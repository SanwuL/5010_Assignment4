**Description**

This project is an interactive data visualization built with p5.js that displays the daily average temperature in Worcester, MA for the year 2025. The data is retrieved using the Open-Meteo historical weather API and rendered as a line chart.

The visualization includes labeled X and Y axes, showing the months of the year and the temperature scale in degrees Celsius. The line represents the daily average temperature across the full year.

The sketch includes two interactive features:

When the mouse moves across the chart, the date corresponding to the cursor position is displayed in the top-left corner.

When the user clicks on the chart, the background color changes based on the selected day's average temperature. The color mapping reflects temperature ranges:

Below 0°C → blue

0–15°C → light blue

15–23°C → light yellow

23–27°C → light green

Above 27°C → light red
